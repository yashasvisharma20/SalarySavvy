# Salary Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the salary of an individual based on various features such as experience, education, job role, and other relevant factors. The model is built using machine learning techniques and deployed as a web application for easy access.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** The primary programming language for implementation.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn:** For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **Flask:** For deploying the model as a web application.
- **Joblib:** For saving and loading the trained model.



## Usage
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Collect data on various features such as experience, education, job role, etc.
   - Preprocess the data using the `data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook.

2. **Model Training:**
   - Train the model using the `model_training.ipynb` notebook.
   - Save the trained model using Joblib.

3. **Web Application:**
   - Run the Flask app:
     ```bash
     cd app
     python app.py
     ```
   - Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to use the salary prediction interface.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/salary-prediction.git
   cd salary-prediction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
